## Future Additions

 - Create a button to clear the wins.
 - Create more interactive buttons, and animated display.
 - Create sounds to alert you of game play.

## Wins 

- Utilized localStorage to save wins at the appropriate time and have them displayed at the appropriate interval.
- Learning to create more clean HTML and CSS code for page styling.
- Delved more in to the separation of the Data Model (the Game and the Players) from DOM manipulation.
- Created the game in less time than I had originally budgeted.
